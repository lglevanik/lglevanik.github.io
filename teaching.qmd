title: "Teaching & Mentoring"
---

As a teaching associate in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, I have experience in a wide range of teaching contexts encompassing large-enrollment introductory lectures, 20-student discussion sections, and one-on-one research mentorship. Across these different settings, my overall philosophy remains grounded in fostering an inclusive, engaging, and student-led learning environment that builds self-efficacy in science and prepares students for a wide range of careers in biology. \
