### Hey there!

My name is Lauren and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCLA. My research focuses on how seed dispersal shapes plant communities. I combine field data with ecological modeling to investigate how species-specific dispersal influences biodiversity locally and across landscapes.\
\
I earned my B.S. in Plant Biology from UC Davis with minors in Professional Writing and Ecology, Evolution, & Biodiversity. There, I also completed my California Naturalist certification,Â which kickstarted my love for community science. You can find me documenting every organism I see on iNaturalist, eBird, or a number of other community science platforms.
