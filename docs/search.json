    "text": "Seed dispersal in annual grassland community assembly\nMy dissertation investigates the role of species-specific seed dispersal in community assembly using a model annual grassland in southern California. The mild winters and hot, dry summers in this system require annual plants to complete an entire life cycle from germination to seed production within only a few months. This condensed period of growth creates intense competition for resources, yet many grasslands are able to host a huge diversity of plant species simultaneously.\nSeed dispersal allows plants to travel in both space and time; dispersal alters patterns of spatial aggregation, and seed persistence delays growth until conditions are tolerable. Both of these aspects influence how species interact with each other as communities assemble annually.\nBetter knowledge of seed movement is critical to understanding how and why biodiverse communities persist. This work informs further research into the mechanisms of biodiversity maintenance, but can also be applied in range expansion modeling, seed-based restoration designs, and identifying target plants for seed banking conservation.\nI conduct my research at UCLA and at Sedgwick Reserve (UC Natural Reserve System) in Santa Barbara County, CA. UCLA acknowledges our institution’s presence on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Gabrielino/Tongva peoples, who are the traditional caretakers of Tovaangar (encompassing areas of the Los Angeles basin & Southern Channel Islands). Additionally, the Chumash peoples are the traditional caretakers of the land where my field research takes place at Sedgwick Reserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispersal evolution and habitat specialization in California vernal pools\nPrior to my PhD, I worked as a field technician alongside postdoctoral researchers in Dr. Nancy Emery’s research group at the University of Colorado - Boulder. This project assessed evolutionary feedback between seed dispersal and habitat specialization. \n\nIn vernal pool environments, rainfall varies year over year and the pools fill to different depths on impermeable hardpan soils. What is perfect habitat in one year can become not so great the next. If a species can diversify where its seeds land, it’s more likely to find something favorable for next year - but if it keeps seeds clustered in one place, there’s no “safety net” if that area becomes unfavorable next year. \n\nThis project investigates the relationships between habitat specialization, differences in landscape patches and suitability, and dispersal strategies in three species of Lasthenia (goldfields) that prefer different submergence depths.\n\nFor thousands of years, the land where Jepson Prairie exists today has been the home of Patwin people, including the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation currently. The Patwin people have remained committed to the stewardship of this land over many centuries. It has been cherished and protected as elders have instructed younger generations. I am honored and grateful to have participated in research here, and to continue to share my enthusiasm for the land’s natural beauty through the docent program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetics & plant breeding in tomatoes\nMy early research experience focused on genetics and plant breeding, specifically in tomatoes. \n\n​Research I presented at the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Conference focused on genetic controls of leaf shape and complexity in heirloom tomatoes.  Plants with simple, wide leaves (a characteristic called potato leaf morph) were expected to have higher fruit sugar content than plants with highly dissected leaflets, thought to be driven by a difference in overall  photosynthetic capacity of these leaves. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to mutate the gene controlling potato leaf morph and analyzed the resulting leaf phenotypes and fruit sugar content. Depending on the type and size of the mutation, leaf phenotypes and sugar content varied widely. Ongoing research investigates how leaf shape contributes to sugar content, with the goal of identifying a simple trait to select in plant breeding that contributes to high fruit sugar content.\n\nFollowing my time at UC Davis, I worked in a tomato breeding research group at a vegetable seed company. I conducted independent research projects for both the fresh market and processing market tomato teams in addition to working with the ongoing seed, greenhouse, and field projects both on-site and in field trials across California’s central valley."

    "text": "Hey there!\nMy name is Lauren and I’m a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCLA. I work with Dr. Nathan Kraft’s plant community ecology group.\n\n​My research focuses on how seed dispersal shapes plant communities. I combine field data with ecological modeling to investigate how species-specific dispersal influences biodiversity locally and across landscapes.\n\nI earned my B.S. in Plant Biology from UC Davis with minors in Professional Writing and Ecology, Evolution, & Biodiversity. There, I also completed my California Naturalist certification, which kickstarted my love for community science. You can find me documenting every organism I see on iNaturalist, eBird, or a number of other community science platforms."

    "text": "Community science (or participatory science) is a collaborative approach to answering scientific questions that engages local communities to collect, analyze, or interpret data. It’s an opportunity to contribute to new discoveries and deepen our understanding of the world, regardless of your background or experience. There are many projects & campaigns that rely on volunteer contributors – some global, some local – so there are lots of ways to get involved.\n​If you’re new to community science and would like to find projects in need of participants, start with SciStarter: this is a great catalog of projects to filter by your interests, resources, and abilities. My favorites to contribute to are iNaturalist, CalFlora, and eBird.\n\n\n  Best of iNaturalist \n\n\n  CalFlora Contributions \n\n\n  eBird & Macaulay Library \n\n\n\nI’m a big fan of iNaturalist, which is a community science platform that collects biodiversity data points from around the globe. Observations that have a specified location, date, time, photographic (or sound) evidence, and multiple species-level identifications from the community are considered “Research Grade.” These data points are added to other biodiversity databases like GBIF, where they’ve informed thousands of published studies.\nFor a California-focused introduction to natural history, I recommend the California Naturalist courses offered through the UC Environmental Stewards program and their many partner organizations across the state. I received my California Naturalist certification in 2019, and it provided a great introduction to both community science and local natural history.\nOne of my favorite ways of sharing California’s gorgeous flora with my community is leading natural history talks and wildflower tours as a docent at Jepson Prairie Preserve in Solano County, CA. Docent-led tours of the vernal pools run each spring on Saturdays and Sundays from mid-March through Mother’s Day. Learn more about the preserve and attending a tour here."
